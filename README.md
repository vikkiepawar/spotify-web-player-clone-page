🎵 Spotify Web Player Clone
A responsive **Spotify Web Player UI clone** built using **HTML and CSS**, focused on layout accuracy, component structure, and modern UI styling inspired by Spotify’s desktop web player.
This project replicates the **visual layout and interaction patterns** of Spotify, including a fixed sidebar, scrollable main content, and a persistent bottom music player.

🚀 Features
- Fixed left sidebar with navigation and library sections  
- Scrollable main content area with sticky top navigation  
- Music cards with hover states and smooth transitions  
- Persistent bottom music player layout  
- Dark theme consistent with Spotify’s design language  
- CSS variables for colors, spacing, typography, and transitions  
- Fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens  

🛠️ Built With
- **HTML5** – semantic structure  
- **CSS3** – Grid, Flexbox, custom properties, media queries  
- **Font Awesome** – icons  
- **Google Fonts (Montserrat)** – typography  

📐 Layout Structure
- **Sidebar**: Fixed navigation and library panel  
- **Main Content**: Scrollable content with playlists and cards  
- **Music Player**: Fixed bottom player with controls and progress bar  
Only the main content scrolls — sidebar and player remain fixed, matching real Spotify behavior.

- Tablet: Adjusted spacing and grid behavior  
- Mobile: Sidebar hidden, optimized player controls  

🎯 Project Goals
- Practice real-world UI layout patterns
